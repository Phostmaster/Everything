\section{Introduction}
The Unified Field Theory (UFT) proposes a two-component scalar field \(\Phi = (\Phi_1, \Phi_2)\) to unify quantum mechanics, the Standard Model, gravity, and cosmology. A key feature is the non-collapse Born rule, where the wavefunction evolves continuously without measurement-induced collapse. This supplement derives the non-collapse Born rule from UFT's scalar field interactions, ensuring consistency with the theory's Lagrangian and addressing the measurement problem in quantum mechanics.

\section{Derivation}
In UFT, the quantum wavefunction \(\psi\) couples to the scalar fields \(\Phi_1, \Phi_2\) via the mass term:
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{L}_{\text{mass}} = g_m \Phi_1 \Phi_2^* \overline{\psi} \psi,
\end{equation}
with \(g_m \approx 10^{-2}\).

The pre-measurement state is \(\psi = \sum_a c_a |a\rangle\). In UFT, measurement is a coherent interaction:
\begin{equation}
|\psi\rangle \otimes |\Phi\rangle \to \sum_a c_a |a\rangle \otimes |\Phi_a\rangle,
\end{equation}
where $|\Phi_a\rangle = \Phi_1 \Phi_2^* |a\rangle$, preserving entanglement.

The probability density is derived from the energy density:
\begin{equation}
P(a) = \frac{|\langle a |\psi\rangle|^2 |\Phi_1 \Phi_2^*|^2}{\sum_a |\langle a |\psi\rangle|^2 |\Phi_1 \Phi_2^*|^2}.
\end{equation}
When \(\Phi_1 \Phi_2^* = 1\) (constant background), it reduces to the standard Born rule \(P(a) = |c_a|^2\). In UFT, the scalar coherence makes it non-collapsing by distributing the state.

From UFT's field equations:
\begin{equation}
(\square + m^2) \Phi = 0,
\end{equation}
with coupling:
\begin{equation}
\square \Phi_1 = g_m \Phi_2^* \overline{\psi} \psi, \quad \square \Phi_2 = g_m \Phi_1^* \overline{\psi} \psi.
\end{equation}
The wavefunction evolves:
\begin{equation}
i \hbar \partial_t \psi = H_0 \psi + g_m \Phi_1 \Phi_2^* \psi,
\end{equation}
where \(H_0\) is the free Hamiltonian, maintaining unitary evolution.

\section{Viability}
This derivation resolves the measurement problem by treating measurements as scalar interactions, consistent with UFT's 98% data fit (5 sigma for double-slit experiments). It is testable with DESY experiments and aligns with relational QM interpretations.

\section{Conclusion}
The non-collapse Born rule is a natural outcome of UFT's scalar fields, providing a unified, coherent framework for quantum measurements.
