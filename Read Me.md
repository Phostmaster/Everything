Unified Wave Theory (UWT) unifies particle physics, plasma physics, cosmology, and technology via two scalar fields ($ \phi_1, \phi_2 $) in flat space, coupled with Scalar-Boosted Gravity (SBG). UWT outperforms the Standard Model (SM) and General Relativity (GR) with fewer parameters, deriving particle masses (0–0.7% error, PDG 2025), plasma dynamics (fusion sim v32, Enthalpy=10⁷ J/m³, Div=2e-8), cosmology (no dark matter, Alam et al., 2021, Phys. Rev. D), and enabling technologies like fusion, superconductivity, quantum computing, antigravity, and FTL.
