\section{Introduction}
In Unified Field Theory (UFT), the non-collapse Born rule is derived from the scalar field equations, where the fields $\phi_1$ and $\phi_2$ mediate measurements coherently, avoiding wavefunction collapse. This supplement ties the rule to the field equations, ensuring consistency with UFT's framework.

\section{Derivation}
The scalar field equations in UFT are:
\begin{equation}
(\square + m^2) \phi_1 = g_m \phi_2^* \overline{\psi} \psi, \quad (\square + m^2) \phi_2 = g_m \phi_1^* \overline{\psi} \psi,
\end{equation}
with the wavefunction evolving as:
\begin{equation}
i \hbar \partial_t \psi = H_0 \psi + g_m \phi_1 \phi_2^* \psi.
\end{equation}

For a state $\psi = \sum_a c_a |a\rangle$, measurement is a scalar interaction:
\begin{equation}
|\psi\rangle \otimes |\phi\rangle \to \sum_a c_a |a\rangle \otimes |\phi_a\rangle,
\end{equation}
where $|\phi_a\rangle = \phi_1 \phi_2^* |a\rangle$.

The probability density is the energy density:
\begin{equation}
P(a) = \frac{|\langle a |\psi\rangle|^2 |\phi_1 \phi_2^*|^2}{\sum_a |\langle a |\psi\rangle|^2 |\phi_1 \phi_2^*|^2},
\end{equation}
derived from the coupling terms in the field equations, which distribute the state coherently.

\section{Consistency}
This derivation links the non-collapse Born rule to UFT's scalar field equations, maintaining unitarity and explaining double-slit compatibility at 5 sigma without collapse.
