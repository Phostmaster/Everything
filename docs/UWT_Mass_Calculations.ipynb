Baseline unscaled Δm = 7.112192e-10 GeV

Note: Tuned Af values are derived from PDG masses (calibration).
Potential weakness: Tunable Af may suggest over-fitting unless derived from first principles (e.g., symmetry, wave numbers).
Theoretical Af uses integer multiples as a hypothesis for prediction.
